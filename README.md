**Task 1:**
This program starts with taking the input of A and B, specifying their data types and then running operations
on the entered variables in the print() statements.

**Task 2:**
This program starts with the input command and data type specification for variable 'A', and then for 'B',
and then all that is left to do is to print both the strings that the user will input at runtime, either by concatenation OR by printing both next to each other.
